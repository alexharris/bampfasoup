Stroszek | Sunday, Jun 4, 2023 | Ambassador of Cinema: Tom Luddy’s Lasting Influence at BAMPFA | <p><em>Stroszek </em>is to Herzog what <em>Ali: Fear Eats the Soul </em>is to Rainer Werner Fassbinder: his most accessible and audience-oriented film to date. Herzog subtitled his film “A Ballad”; in it he tells a lyrical, melancholy, bitterly funny tale of three oddly assorted Berlin misfits who follow the American Dream to Railroad Flats, Wisconsin, a godforsaken truck stop where they find a bleak El Dorado of TV football, CB radio, and mobile homesteading. The title role is played by Bruno S., the Berlin busker and former mental institution inmate whom Herzog previously cast to play Kaspar Hauser.</p>

L’immensità | Saturday, Apr 15, 2023 | 66th San Francisco International Film Festival at BAMPFA | <p>Emanuele Crialese’s first film in eleven years is a personal portrait of two outsiders trying to escape the confines of their environment. Clara (Penélope Cruz), an effusive but slightly manic mother raising three kids in 1970s Rome, tries to make family life a party amid a loveless marriage, while her eldest daughter, Adri, experiences gender dysphoria in an era when the term doesn’t really exist. Blending intimate scenes of family drama with surreal musical sequences, and anchored by Cruz’s multilayered performance, <em>L’immensità</em> is a tremendous return from a director whose work SFFILM has championed from the very beginning.</p>
Shadow of Our Forgotten Ancestors | Sunday, Mar 1, 2015 | NOSERIES | <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-1a126558-7d49-03c3-53a7-71de74ca88bf"><span>With this gorgeous picture set among a small Ukrainian sect, Sergei Paradjanov “was the first to indicate the degree to which folklore and local artistic tradition could once again become a source of visual wealth in Soviet national cinema. In the beautiful but fierce Carpathian Mountains, an environment of overwhelming Christian-pagan rituals, demonology, and constant struggle with overpowering elements, a story of love unfolds. Adopting the great master Dovzhenko’s use of symbolism and metaphor, and his lyric photography, Paradjanov adds a dynamically active camera suited to the requirements of his energetic and temperamental character” (Yvette Biro).</span></span></p>

Wavemakers | Tuesday, Mar 10, 2015 | NOSERIES | <p>While you may never have heard of the ondes Martenot, you may have heard the evocative tones that emit from this unique electronic instrument. Its distinctive timbre has been used in soundtracks for the sci-fi TV show Thunderbirds as well as feature films from Lawrence of Arabia to There Will Be Blood. The French musician and educator Maurice Martenot was a telegraph operator during World War I, when he was transfixed by the sounds emanating from radio vacuum tubes. He spent the rest of his life perfecting his ondes, an instrument that converts electricity into music, and one so mysterious that its secrets are still being unraveled.</p>
