Sunday, Jun 4, 2023 | 5 PM | NOTIME2 | Ambassador of Cinema: Tom Luddy’s Lasting Influence at BAMPFA | Stroszek | Stroszek | alt title | <p><em>Stroszek </em>is to Herzog what <em>Ali: Fear Eats the Soul </em>is to Rainer Werner Fassbinder: his most accessible and audience-oriented film to date. Herzog subtitled his film “A Ballad”; in it he tells a lyrical, melancholy, bitterly funny tale of three oddly assorted Berlin misfits who follow the American Dream to Railroad Flats, Wisconsin, a godforsaken truck stop where they find a bleak El Dorado of TV football, CB radio, and mobile homesteading. The title role is played by Bruno S., the Berlin busker and former mental institution inmate whom Herzog previously cast to play Kaspar Hauser.</p> | film note author | film note author title | legacy credits | Werner Herzog | Werner Herzog,  | Thomas Mauch,  | Bruno S., Eva Mattes, Clemens Scheitz, Wilhelm von Homburg,  | West Germany,  | 1977 | run time | American Genre Film Archive,  |  | Werner Herzog,  | BAMPFA
Saturday, Jun 3, 2023 | 5 PM | NOTIME2 | Ambassador of Cinema: Tom Luddy’s Lasting Influence at BAMPFA | Such a Pretty Little Beach | Such a Pretty Little Beach | alt title | <p>Set within the confines of an off-season inn and a nearby beach, cut off from the world by rain and cold, <em>Such a Pretty Little Beach</em> is a masterwork in the best film noir tradition: it grips by the sheer cohesion of its construction. Gérard Philipe evokes a remarkable tension between suspicion and sympathy as a melancholy young man who becomes a curiosity to the inn’s residents and regular guests (characters who are curious enough in themselves). The narrative takes place in several time zones while never leaving the “present.” Sans flashbacks or monologues, the story unfolds: the young man’s childhood as a public assistance ward at this very inn, his mysterious involvement with a famous actress, and the psychological implications of his return to the site of his youth. Yves Allégret’s noirs recall the mood of poetic fatalism of the late 1930s, but he avoids all arty flourishes and eccentricities in pitilessly revealing the dark side of human behavior. Many critics consider this rarely shown film to be his best.</p> | film note author | film note author title | legacy credits | Yves Allégret | Jacques Sigurd,  | Henri Alekan,  | Gérard Philipe, Madeleine Robinson, Jean Servais, Jane Marken,  | France,  | 1949 | run time | Pathé Films,  | Janus Films,  | Edith Kramer, Jean-Pierre Gorin,  | BAMPFA
Thursday, Jun 8, 2023 | 7 PM | NOTIME2 | Ambassador of Cinema: Tom Luddy’s Lasting Influence at BAMPFA | King Lear | King Lear | alt title | <p>Jean-Luc Godard’s <em>King Lear</em>, predictably, is not a costume drama set in pre-Christian England. Instead, we follow William Shakespeare V (Peter Sellars) as he wanders through a post-Chernobyl world, “a time when movies and art no longer exist and must be reinvented,” trying to reconstruct his ancestor’s play, aided and abetted by Herr Doktor Professor Pluggy, played by Godard himself. The film oscillates between telling the story of its own production and reconstructing Lear as a Mafia chieftain engaged in interminable rows with his daughters in interminable hotel rooms. Brilliant, witty, infuriating, the film testifies, yet again, to Godard’s astonishing engagement with sound and image—and, despite all his own protestations, to an engagement with Shakespeare’s text.</p> | film note author | film note author title | legacy credits | Jean-Luc Godard | Norman Mailer, Peter Sellars, Tom Luddy,  | Sophie Maintigneux,  | Jean-Luc Godard, Peter Sellars, Burgess Meredith, Molly Ringwald,  | Switzerland, United States,  | 1987 | run time | Park Circus,  |  |  | BAMPFA

Clara (Penélope Cruz), an effusive but slightly manic mother raising three kids in 1970s Rome, tries to make family life a party amid a loveless marriage, while her eldest daughter, Adri, experiences gender dysphoria in an era when the term doesn’t really exist. Blending intimate scenes of family drama with surreal musical sequences, and anchored by Cruz’s multilayered performance, <em>L’immensità</em> is a tremendous return from a director whose work SFFILM has championed from the very beginning.</p> | film note author | film note author title | legacy credits | Emanuele Crialese | Francesca Manieri, Vittorio Moroni,  | Emanuele Crialese, Gergely Pohárnok,  | Penélope Cruz, Vincenzo Amato, Luana Giuliani,  | Italy, France,  | 2022 | run time | SFFILM,  |  |  | BAMPFA

Adopting the great master Dovzhenko’s use of symbolism and metaphor, and his lyric photography, Paradjanov adds a dynamically active camera suited to the requirements of his energetic and temperamental character” (Yvette Biro).</span></span></p> | film note author | film note author title | legacy credits | Sergei Paradjanov | Sergei Paradjanov, Ivan Chendei,  | Yuri Ilyenko,  | Ivan Nikolaichuk, Larisa Kadochnikova, Tatiana Bestaeva, Spartak Bagashvili,  | USSR,  | 1964 | run time |  |  |  | Pacific Film Archive Theater
