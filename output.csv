Stroszek | Sunday, Jun 4, 2023 | Ambassador of Cinema: Tom Luddy’s Lasting Influence at BAMPFA | <p><em>Stroszek </em>is to Herzog what <em>Ali: Fear Eats the Soul </em>is to Rainer Werner Fassbinder: his most accessible and audience-oriented film to date. Herzog subtitled his film “A Ballad”; in it he tells a lyrical, melancholy, bitterly funny tale of three oddly assorted Berlin misfits who follow the American Dream to Railroad Flats, Wisconsin, a godforsaken truck stop where they find a bleak El Dorado of TV football, CB radio, and mobile homesteading. The title role is played by Bruno S., the Berlin busker and former mental institution inmate whom Herzog previously cast to play Kaspar Hauser.</p> | Werner Herzog | Thomas Mauch | American Genre Film Archive | Bruno S., Eva Mattes, Clemens Scheitz, Wilhelm von Homburg,
